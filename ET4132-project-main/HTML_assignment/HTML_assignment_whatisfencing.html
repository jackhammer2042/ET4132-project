            <h1>What is Fencing?</h1>
            <p>Fencing is a 1v1 turn based combat sport, where both players aim to strike their opponent once with their chosen weapon!</p><br>
         
			<h2>There is more then 1 sword?</h2><br>
			<p>Yes fencing is split between 3 different disciplines, Saber(like star wars), Epee(Modern day Rapiers) and finally Foil, which is a sword truly unique to fencing</p><br>
			
			<h2>Whats the difference between the 3?</h2><br>
        </div>

		<div class="saber">
            <img src="Images/saber.jpg" alt="Saber" class="saberpic">
            <p>Each sword has it's own unique fighting style and ruleset! Saber is the weapon of choice at UL, Sabers are fast and aggressive. Matches are more based on fastfire reflexes more then strategy, In saber anywhere above the belt is fair game to score a Point.</p>
        </div>   

        <div class="epee">
            <p>In Epee matches are long drawn out affairs, anywhere on the body counts as a viable place to score a point. Epee is the most strategic sword and the one with the most memes about it.</p>
            <img src="Images/epee.jpg" alt="Epee" class="epeepic">
        </div>

        <div class="foil">
            <img src="Images/foil.png" alt="foil" class="foilpic">
            <p> Foil is the first of the fencing swords invented 
            and stands in the middle between the speed of the Saber and Strategy of the Epee. Foil aims for the chest or the neck and is unique where the other 2 swords have a rule where your feet can't cross the foil has no such rule making footwork a much bigger deal.
            The sword is also strict in how easy it is too loose your turn attacking An attack with foil is the most nerve wracking but also the most exciting!</p>
